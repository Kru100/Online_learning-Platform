acc_1 is a placeholder for the account ID of the linked account you create for the teacher on Razorpay.
When you create a linked account for a teacher, Razorpay will provide you with an account ID that you can use to refer to that account when 
creating routes. 
It's not the bank account number of the teacher, but an identifier used by Razorpay.
As for where to apply this code, it would typically be in a view or a service that gets called when a student enrolls in a course.
For example, you might have an EnrollmentCreateView that handles the enrollment process. 
This view would collect the necessary information from the student, create the order with Razorpay, and then create an Enrollment instance 
in your database if the payment is successful.
